# How to localize Fider

English files `en/client.json` and `en/server.json` are the only files that should be modified during development.

All other locale files are sourced from [Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/project/fider). If you're looking to contribute with a new translation, a correction or improvement, please use Crowdin.
